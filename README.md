# Chisel Mini Project

Inspired by the [Chisel Bootcamp](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel-bootcamp), this mini project aims to introduce Scala and Chisel in a use case oriented method. By the end of this mini project you would have built a _very_ simple compiler in Scala which converts a subset of Risc-V assembly language to machine code and a _very_ simple CPU written in Chisel to execute the compiled code. 
This is by no means a tutorial for Risc-V or Compiler or CPU architecture, it is just using a bare minimal of those concepts to give purpose to this project.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Verilog, VHDL, or at least some digital hardware design
- Programming experience in with a "high-level" language, be it in Python, Java, C++, etc.
- Basic knowledge of Risc-V assembly

## Getting Started

The content here is designed around the Jupyter notebook to provide explanations and code snippets which can be edited and executed within the browser itself.
